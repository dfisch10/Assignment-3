# Assignment 3 - Palindrome

In this assignment we were tasked with using TDD (Test Driven Development) to solve the palindrome problem. We were given access to the base application, as well as the unit tests (and a set of data sources used by the tests). We then had to develop the application logic to ensure that all tests passed, and that there was 100% code coverage. We then needed to alter the remote origin and push it to our own GitHub repository.

# How It Works 
The application will take user input in the form of a string, and then it will check to see if it is a 'valid' palindrome, meaning that the string/word/phrase is the same when read backwards or forwards.
